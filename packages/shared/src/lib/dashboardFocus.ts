/**
 * Shared helpers for the dashboard "focus" layer (web + mobile).
 *
 * The Hub surfaces at most one primary recommendation (the *focus*)
 * plus a collapsed list of secondary ones (the *rest*). Both platforms
 * need the same contract for:
 *
 *  - the localStorage / MMKV key used to persist per-recommendation
 *    dismissal timestamps (`hub_recs_dismissed_v1`);
 *  - a defensive parser for that payload (legacy / corrupted storage
 *    shouldn't crash the dashboard);
 *  - filtering dismissed recs out and splitting the remainder into
 *    `{ focus, rest }`.
 *
 * Hook glue (React state, interval refreshes, MMKV subscription) lives
 * per-platform; this file is pure.
