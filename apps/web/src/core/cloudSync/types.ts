 * "two bools disagree" class of bugs. The legacy booleans are kept as
 * derived getters on the hook return value so existing consumers compile
 * unchanged.

 *   idle   → dirty            (local write marked a module dirty)
 *   dirty  → queued           (offline enqueue before server reached)
 *   *      → syncing          (onStart)
 *   syncing → success         (onSuccess)
 *   syncing → error           (onError)
 *   success|error → idle      (onSettled, if nothing new is queued)

 * can classify it (network vs. 5xx vs. unknown) without parsing message

 * tests that mock only `onError`) can simply leave `onErrorRaw`
