/**
 * Top-level React Query provider with MMKV-backed persistence.
 *
 * Replaces the plain `QueryClientProvider` with
 * `PersistQueryClientProvider` so that `useQuery` hooks warm-start
 * from disk on app launch — critical for offline-first behavior on
 * mobile, where the user might open the app on a subway platform
 * before any network request has a chance to run.
 *
 * Persistence is wired through `@/sync/persister/mmkvPersister`,
 * which writes to the shared MMKV instance under the mobile-prefixed
 * `STORAGE_KEYS.MOBILE_QUERY_CACHE` key (see
 * `packages/shared/src/lib/storageKeys.ts`).
