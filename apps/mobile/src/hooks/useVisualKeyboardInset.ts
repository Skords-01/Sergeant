/**
 * Mobile adapter for the shared visual-keyboard-inset contract.
 *
 * Binds the `@sergeant/shared` contract to React Native's `Keyboard`
 * module: the hook subscribes to `keyboardDidShow` /
 * `keyboardDidHide` and reports the reported keyboard height (dp) so
 * bottom sheets can lift themselves above the on-screen keyboard
 * without depending on `react-native-keyboard-controller` or
 * `react-native-reanimated`.
 *
 * When `active` is `false` the hook short-circuits to 0 and skips
 * wiring up listeners — this mirrors the web adapter and keeps
 * unnecessary listeners off the `Keyboard` module while sheets are
 * closed.
 *
 * Importing this module has the side-effect of registering the mobile
 * adapter on the shared contract. Do this once from
 * `app/_layout.tsx`, next to the haptic / file-download adapters.
