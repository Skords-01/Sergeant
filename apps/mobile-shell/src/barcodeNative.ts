/**
 * Native barcode scanning adapter.
 *
 * This module lives in `@sergeant/mobile-shell` on purpose: it is the only
 * place in the workspace where `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning` is
 * imported statically. `@sergeant/web` MUST load it via dynamic `import()`
 * so the ML Kit code ends up in an async chunk that browsers never fetch
 * (the feature-detect in `@sergeant/shared` gates the call).
 *
 * We normalize the plugin's result into the `BarcodeResult` shape exported
 * by `@sergeant/web`'s `useBarcodeScanner` hook, so callers never need to
 * know which platform produced the scan.
